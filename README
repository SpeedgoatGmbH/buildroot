#### Embedded Platform Buildroot Repository ####

This version of buildroot is setup to generate full SD card images for a number
of platforms.The platforms supported can be found by reviewing the 
board/mathworks/<platform> directories.


The SD card generation system dynamically generates a buildroot configuration,
builds it and runs a number of post-processing scripts. The overall execution
is controlled via the build.sh script.

The build.sh script can be invoked with the following syntax:

./build.sh [options]<board_dir> <configname>

The format of configname is defined by the underlying board dir, but is generally:

<board>_<os>_<toolchain>

The specifics of the syntax can be found in each <board_dir>'s build.sh script

Some examples:
==============

Build the SoCFPGA platform for the SoCKit board running Linux with the Linaro
toolchain:

./build.sh board/mathworks/socfpga sockit_linux_linaro


Build the Zynq platform for the Zed board running Linux with the Xilinx
toolchain:

./build.sh board/mathworks/zynq zed_linux_xilinx
